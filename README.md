# Whatcha-Reading
NSS C8 - P2-W4 - Half capstone Ruby

## Project Vision

This will be a small command-line program that asks the user to track the books she's reading.

Users will be able to add book title and author, reading start and end dates, a short plot description, and a mini-review (in order to know whether they want to recommend the book to others).
